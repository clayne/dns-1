# IBM ResellOne end of service

Effective 1 November 2021, IBM Cloud no longer supports the IBM ResellOne Domain Resale service, which we offer in partnership with Tucows Inc.
{: important}

On 1 November 2021, depending on how many domains that you are managing, Tucows, and IBM Cloud will automatically migrate your domains and reseller accounts over to Tucowsâ€™ retail domain platform, [Hover](https://hover.com/){: external} or the [OpenSRS](https://manage.opensrs.com/){: external} reseller platform.

For more information and actions that you must take, see [Migrating from IBM ResellOne to Tucows](/docs/dns?topic=dns-resellone-migration).

Contact [IBM Cloud Support](/docs/dns?topic=dns-gettinghelp-with-dns) with any questions about migration options, or reach out to your Customer Success Manager or Technical Account Manager if you have these services.
