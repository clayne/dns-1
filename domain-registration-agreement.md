# Domain Registration Agreement
{: #domain-registration-agreement}

This Domain Registration Agreement ("Agreement") is between SoftLayer Technologies, Inc. ("SoftLayer", an IBM Company) and You and is effective on the date You accept it electronically. This Agreement represents the entire agreement between You and IBM Cloud regarding Your use of IBM Cloud Domain Name Registration Services (the “Services”). You acknowledge that You read, understand, and agree to be bound by this Agreement, along with any new, different, or additional terms, conditions or policies which IBM Cloud might establish from time to time. Your use – or continued use – of the Services after being provided notice of this Agreement constitutes acceptance of the Agreement. You agree to be bound by this Agreement for transactions entered into by You or anyone acting as Your Agent, and by anyone who uses the account You have established with IBM Cloud.
You acknowledge that IBM Cloud is a registrar bound by an agreement with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ("ICANN"). You agree that IBM Cloud may modify this Agreement in order to comply with applicable law and the terms and conditions set forth by ICANN from time to time.

## Fees
{: #domain-registration-agreement-fees}

You agree to pay IBM Cloud for the Services You purchase at the time they are provided. You understand that ICANN requires IBM Cloud to collect a small registration fee when You register a domain name, and You agree to pay such fees. Payments are non-refundable. If for any reason IBM Cloud is unable to charge Your payment method for the full amount owed, or if IBM Cloud is charged a penalty for any fee it previously charged to Your payment method, You agree that IBM Cloud may pursue all available remedies in order to obtain payment, including immediate cancellation, without notice, of any domain names registered or renewed by You or on Your behalf. IBM Cloud reserves the right to charge a reasonable service fee for administrative tasks outside the scope of its regular Services, including customer service issues that cannot be handled over email but require personal service, and disputes that require legal services. These charges will be billed to the payment method on file for You.

## Domain Name Renewals
{: #domain-registration-agreement-renewals}

You have the option to elect automatic renewal of the domain names You register, in which case IBM Cloud will automatically renew Your domain(s) for a period equivalent to the length of Your original registration, and will take payment from the payment method You have on file, at IBM Cloud's then-current rates. Domain name renewals are non-refundable. If IBM Cloud is not able to process payment for an automatic renewal, and You fail to respond to our notices, Your domain name registration will expire. It is Your responsibility to keep Your payment information current. If You do not elect automatic renewal, You have the responsibility of manually renewing Your domain by the expiration date. If You fail to manually renew in a timely fashion the domain name will be cancelled and You will no longer have use of that name. You agree that IBM Cloud will not be responsible for cancelled domain names that You fail to renew, either automatically or manually. If You do fail to renew Your domain name in a timely fashion, additional charges may apply. (Current fees for post-expiration renewal can be found here: https://www.ibm.com/cloud/dns). If You signed up for any other services in conjunction with Your domain registration, these services may be automatically renewed when Your domain registration is renewed, and You may incur additional renewal fees unless You cancel in advance.
IBM Cloud sends domain renewal reminders via email to the registered owner contact in accordance with the ICANN Expired Registration Recovery Policy. The notices are sent as follows:

* IBM Cloud will send a first renewal reminder notice approximately 30 days before the domain registration expires, and a second notice approximately 1 week before expiration. Both of those notices will be sent to the email address on file for the owner of the domain registration.

* IBM Cloud will send ONE more renewal reminder notice by email to the owner of the domain registration 3 days after expiration.

If You fail to renew Your domain name, You agree that IBM Cloud may choose to renew it on Your behalf, in which case You will have a grace period during which You may reimburse IBM Cloud for the renewal and keep Your domain name. The renewal grace period is currently 30 days but is subject to change under the terms of Section 2 of this Agreement.

If You do not reimburse IBM Cloud for the renewal during the renewal grace period, Your domain name will be placed on hold and flagged for deletion after which You will have a 30-day period during which You may pay IBM Cloud a redemption fee and redeem Your domain name. The current redemption fee, which is subject to change, can be found at https://www.ibm.com/cloud/dns. If You do not redeem Your domain name prior to the end of the redemption grace period IBM Cloud may, at its sole discretion, delete Your domain name or transfer it to another registrant on Your behalf.

## Term of Agreement; Modifications
{: #domain-registration-agreement-modifications}

This Agreement continues in full force and effect as long as You have any domain name registered through IBM Cloud. You agree that You will not transfer any domain name registered through IBM Cloud to another domain name registrar during the first sixty (60) days from its initial registration date. You further agree that IBM Cloud may charge You a small fee if You cancel Your domain within the five-day grace period after registering Your domain with IBM Cloud and IBM Cloud refunds the price of Your domain. IBM Cloud will not charge You a fee if IBM Cloud cancels Your domain name during this period because of fraud.

You agree that IBM Cloud may modify this Agreement from time to time, and You agree to be bound by any such changes. IBM Cloud may also discontinue services it provides under this Agreement. Should You elect to cancel Your Agreement, You will not receive a refund for any fees You have paid to IBM Cloud.

You agree that IBM Cloud is not bound by any representations made by third parties who You may use to purchase services from IBM Cloud, and that any statements of a general nature which may be posted on IBM Cloud’s website or contained in IBM Cloud’s promotional materials will not bind IBM Cloud.

## Your Account Information
{: #domain-registration-account-information}

It is Your responsibility to keep Your account information current. If You fail to do so, or fail to respond within five business days of IBM Cloud inquiring as to the validity of Your information, You will be in material breach of this Agreement.

You agree that for each domain name You register, the following information will be made publicly available in the Whois directory, and may be sold in bulk, as set forth by ICANN policy and the ICANN agreement:

* The domain name
* Your name and postal address
* The email address, postal address, voice and fax numbers for technical and administrative contacts
* The Internet protocol numbers for the primary and secondary name servers
* The corresponding names of the name servers
* The original date of registration and expiration date

You agree that, to the extent permitted by ICANN, IBM Cloud may make use of the publicly available information You provided during the registration process. If You engage in the reselling of domain names, You agree to obtain informed consent, and evidence of consent, from those individuals about the possible use of the personal information they provide, pursuant to ICANN policy.

## Transfer of Domain Names
{: #domain-registration-agreement-transfer}

If You transfer any domain name, You agree to abide by the procedures and conditions set forth in this Agreement. Any domain registered with IBM Cloud or transferred to IBM Cloud will be placed on lock status. The domain must be placed in unlock status in order to modify any of the Whois information, including the name servers, or initiate a transfer of the domain name away from IBM Cloud to a new Registrar.

You agree that, prior to transferring ownership of a domain name to another person (the “Transferee”), You will require the Transferee to agree in writing to be bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If the Transferee does not do so, the transfer will be null and void. You explicitly authorize IBM Cloud and its agents to act as Designated Agent, as stipulated by ICANN Transfer Policy, to approve a change of registrant on Your behalf.

## Resale Practices
{: #domain-registration-agreement-resale-practices}

If any customers of Yours acquire domain names through You using IBM Cloud’s registration services, You hereby agree as follows:

* You will obtain each of Your customer’s acceptance of IBM Cloud's then-current Domain Registration Agreement, and will retain evidence of their acceptance for at least a period of not less than three years.

* You agree that IBM Cloud is not lending You access to its registrar connections or its registry access, nor will You attempt to gain such access.
* You agree to provide complete, accurate and current data for each registrant in accordance with ICANN.
* You agree to provide Your customers with adequate customer support and provide them a medium for communicating changes in the information they provided as part of the domain name registration process, and to provide such information to IBM Cloud in a timely fashion so IBM Cloud can update its registration records. You will retain copies of all communications between You and Your customers and will, upon request, provide IBM Cloud copies of same.
* You will not display the ICANN or ICANN-Accredited Registrar logo, or otherwise represent Yourself as Accredited by ICANN, unless You have written permission from ICANN to do so.

* You will identify IBM Cloud as the sponsoring registrar upon inquiry from the customer.
* You agree to inform any customer of Yours, who may be acquiring a domain name through You using IBM Cloud’s registration services, that they are in fact registering their domain name through IBM Cloud and that IBM Cloud is an accredited registrar with ICANN.
* You will comply with any ICANN-adopted Specification or Policy that establishes a program for accreditation of individuals or entities who provide proxy and privacy registration services (a “Proxy Accreditation Program”).
* You will provide Your customers with a link to the ICANN webpage detailing registrant educational information, as follows: https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/responsibilities-2014-03-14-en.

* You will provide Your customers access to the ICANN Registrant’s Benefits and Responsibilities Specification and will not take any actions inconsistent with them.

## Restriction of Services; Right of Refusal
{: #domain-registration-agreement-restriction}

You agree not to use the Services, or to allow or enable others to use the Services, for the purposes of:

* The transmission of unsolicited email (Spam).
* Repetitive, high volume inquiries into any of the services provided by IBM Cloud (i.e. domain name availability, etc.).
* If You are hosting Your domain's name servers ("DNS") on IBM Cloud's servers, or are using IBM Cloud’s systems to forward a domain, URL, or otherwise to a system or site hosted elsewhere, or if You have Your domain name registered with IBM Cloud, You are responsible for ensuring that there is no excessive overloading on IBM Cloud's DNS systems.
* You may not use IBM Cloud's servers and/or Your domain as a source, intermediary, reply-to address, or destination address for mail bombs, Internet packet flooding, packet corruption, server hacking, security breaches or other abusive attacks. You agree that IBM Cloud reserves the right to deactivate Your domain name from its DNS system if IBM Cloud deems it is the recipient of activities caused by Your site that threaten the stability of its network.
* You agree that IBM Cloud, in its sole discretion and without liability to You, may refuse to accept the registration of any domain name. IBM Cloud also may, in its sole discretion and without liability to You, delete the registration of any domain name during the first thirty (30) days after registration has taken place. IBM Cloud may also cancel the registration of a domain name, after thirty (30) days, if that name is being used in association with spam or morally objectionable activities. Morally objectionable activities include, but are not limited to: activities designed to defame, embarrass, harm, abuse, threaten, slander or harass third parties; activities prohibited by the laws of the United States and/or foreign territories in which You conduct business; activities designed to encourage unlawful behavior by others, such as hate crimes, terrorism and child pornography; activities that are tortious, vulgar, obscene, invasive of the privacy of a third party, racially, ethnically, or otherwise objectionable; activities designed to impersonate the identity of a third party; and activities designed to harm minors in any way. In the event IBM Cloud refuses a registration or deletes an existing registration during the first thirty (30) days after registration, You will receive a refund of any fees paid to IBM Cloud in connection with the registration either being canceled or refused, unless the deletion was the result of the domain name being used in association with spam or morally objectionable activities, in which case, no refund will be issued.

## Suspension of Services; Breach of Agreement
{: #domain-registration-agreement-suspension}

You agree that Your ability to use the Services is subject to cancellation or suspension if there is an unresolved breach of this Agreement and/or suspension or cancellation is required by any policy now in effect or adopted later by ICANN.

You agree that Your failure to comply completely with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any IBM Cloud rule or policy may be considered a material breach of this Agreement. In the event that You do not provide IBM Cloud with material evidence refuting such breach within ten (10) business days after receiving notice of the breach, IBM Cloud may terminate its relationship with You and take any remedial action available to IBM Cloud under applicable laws, including canceling the registration of any of Your domain names and discontinuing any services provided to You. No fees will be refunded to You should Your agreement be cancelled or services be discontinued because of a breach. IBM Cloud's failure to act upon or notify You of any event, which may constitute a breach, shall not relieve You from or excuse You of the fact that You have committed a breach.

## Dispute Resolution Policy
{: #domain-registration-agreement-dispute-resolution}

You agree to be bound by our current Dispute Resolution Policy, which is incorporated herein and made a part of this Agreement. You can view the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy online. You agree that IBM Cloud may from time to time modify its Dispute Resolution Policy. IBM Cloud will post any changes to its Dispute Resolution Policy at least 30 days before they become effective. You agree that by maintaining Your domain name registrations with IBM Cloud after the updated policy becomes effective that You agree to the Dispute Resolution policy as amended. You agree to review IBM Cloud’s web site periodically to determine if changes have been made to the Dispute Resolution Policy.

You agree that if a dispute arises as a result of one or more domain names You have registered using IBM Cloud, You will indemnify, defend and hold IBM Cloud harmless as provided for in this Agreement. You also agree that if IBM Cloud is notified that a complaint has been filed with a governmental, administrative or judicial body regarding a domain name registered by You using IBM Cloud, that IBM Cloud, in its sole discretion, may take whatever action IBM Cloud deems necessary regarding further modification, assignment of and/or control of the domain name deemed necessary to comply with the actions or requirements of the governmental, administrative or judicial body until such time as the dispute is settled. In this event You agree to hold IBM Cloud harmless for any action taken by IBM Cloud.

## Limitation of Liability
{: #domain-registration-agreement-limitation-liability}

You agree that IBM Cloud's entire liability to You under this Agreement, and Your only remedy, in connection with any service provided by IBM Cloud to You under this Agreement, and for any breach of this Agreement by IBM Cloud, shall be limited to the fees You paid to IBM Cloud for the particular service in contention. IBM Cloud and its agents and contractors shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages resulting from the use of or inability to use any of IBM Cloud's services or for the cost of obtaining substitute services. Because certain states do not permit the limitation of elimination of liability for certain types of damage, IBM Cloud’s liability shall be limited as much as permitted by applicable law.

Should IBM Cloud be notified of a pending lawsuit, or receive notice of the filing of a lawsuit, IBM Cloud may seek a written confirmation from You concerning Your obligation to indemnify IBM Cloud. Your failure to provide such a confirmation may be considered a breach of this Agreement.
